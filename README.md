I am Full Stack Developer seeking a role where I can learn something new every day. I taught myself to code in last year or so and enjoyed it so much that I changed career and re-trained at Northcoders.

I am very passionate about technology and love to be challenged, web development to me is the perfect combination of the two.

I'm self motivated, driven and has the capacity to deliver on time.

Before re-training I ran my own business as an electrical installation services for construction industory.

## Northcoders ##

Software Development Bootcamp attended from Nov 6 2017 to Feb 02 2018. It was a rigorous and comprehensive training to the folloowing asspects:
- OOP, TDD, MVC
- Agile methodology
- Javascript, Nodejs, Express
- DataBases, React
- Mocha, Chai
- HTML, CSS
## Construction Industory ##
**Electrical Instalation Contractor** (2009 - Present)

### Transferable Skills ###
Some of transferable skills by working in the construction industory which I have applied during my training are:
- ***Organisation and time management:*** As on the construction site, work environment is collaborative and divided in teams of different professionals, so organization of the work is very important otherwise dependent teams run in chaos. This really benefited me durring the training at northcoders as it was too comprehensive and need to take alot in comparatively less time.To achive this I organised a time chart for the traing,practice and reading material.
- ***Team Work:*** I applied this skill in pair programming and it was proved to be an adventage as pairs have different problem solving approaches but previous experience of the team worling led me work more efficiently and productively on our sprints.
- ***Deliverance:*** In software industory the biggest challenge is to deliver on time, on most of our sprint the work is done in such a way that a MVP will be deliver by the end of the sprint time

[Northcoders News API](https://github.com/najmi-smile/BE-FT-northcoders-news) | [Web Link](https://quiet-shore-88770.herokuapp.com/) | RESTFull API to serve the data | Nodejs, Express, MogoDB | Chai, Mocha
[Northcoders News FrontEnd](https://github.com/najmi-smile/FE-FT-NC-News) | [WebLink](https://ncoders-news.herokuapp.com/) | A website which aggregate data from the [Northcoders News API](https://github.com/najmi-smile/BE-FT-northcoders-news) | React, WebPack | N/A
[NC Buddy](https://github.com/najmi-smile/NC-Companion) | Final Project | A fullstack web project build by the team of 4 | React, Firebase | N/A

Skills which I adhere from the work in the past, the social experience and also firmly belive upon are:
- **Communication** - Each day over the last 12 weeks, I have been pair programing or working in Agile team of 3-4 people
- **Fast and Addaptable** - Whilst at Northcoders I have been challenged to both learn new tecnologies and complete the sprint in that, which vastly expand my learning and improve the adaptability. Final project is another showcase for this in which I have learned firebase and implemented to the project. Please view my [Projects](projects).
- **Analytical thinker / Problem Solver** - Having taken some complex  challenges, I have greatly expanded my analytical abilities. An example would be the [Northcoders News FrontEnd](https://github.com/najmi-smile/FE-FT-NC-News) project. Understanding and building involved diagramming, planning, discussions, prototyping and testing before the actual coding of the project.
