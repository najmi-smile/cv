I am Full Stack Developer seeking a role where I can learn something new every day. I taught myself to code in last year or so and enjoyed it so much that I changed career and re-trained at Northcoders.

I am very passionate about technology and love to be challenged, web development to me is the perfect combination of the two.

Before re-training I ran my own business as an electrical installation services for construction industory.
